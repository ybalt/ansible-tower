# ansible-tower

Dockerfile for standalone [Ansible Tower](https://www.ansible.com/tower) 3.x+

# Build
```
docker build --no-cache --squash -t ansible-tower:${TOWER_VERSION} .
```

# Run

Run Ansible Tower with a random port:
```
docker run -d -P --name tower ybalt/ansible-tower
```

or map to exposed port 443:
```
docker run -d -p 443:443 --name tower ybalt/ansible-tower
```

To include certificate and license on container creation:
```
docker run -t -d -v ~/certs:/certs -p 443:443 -e SERVER_NAME=localhost  ansible-tower
```

To persist Ansible Tower database, create a data container:
```
docker create -v /var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main --name tower-data ybalt/ansible-tower /bin/true
docker run -d -p 443:443 --name tower --volumes-from tower-data ybalt/ansible-tower
```
or use create a Docker Volume on the host:
```
docker run -d -p 443:443 -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/9.6/main --name ansible-tower ybalt/ansible-tower
```

If you want to persist any Ansible project data saved at `/var/lib/awx/projects` directory, create a Docker Volume on using the command below:
```
docker run -d -p 443:443 -v ~/ansible_projects:/var/lib/awx/projects --name ansible-tower ybalt/ansible-tower
```

# Certificates and License

The ansible-tower Docker image uses a generic certificate generated for www.ansible.com by the Ansible Tower setup
program. If you generate your own certificate, it will be copied into /etc/tower by the entrypoint script if a volume
is mapped to /certs in the container, e.g:

* /certs/tower.cert -> /etc/tower/tower.cert
* /certs/tower.key  -> /etc/tower/tower.key

The environment variable SERVER_NAME should match the common name of the generated certificate and will be used to update
the nginx configuration file.

A license file can also be included similar to the certificates by renaming your Ansible Tower license file to **license** and
placing it in your local, mapped volume. The entrypoint script checks for the license file seperately and does not depend
on the certificates.

* /certs/license -> /etc/tower/license

The license file can also be uploaded on first login to the Ansible Tower web interface.
